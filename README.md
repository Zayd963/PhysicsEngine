# PhysicsEngine
My SDL based Circle vs Circle Physics Engine... Made in a Week!

# How to use
Must Run On x86 Platform Within Visual Studio.
Use the left mouse button to grab and move circles.
Click and drag the right mouse button on a circle to send it in that direction like a pool cue.
in PhysicsEntity.cpp there is a line that may be commented out to remove the attraction the the star.

# Stuff included
All of SDL and SDL_Image is included and all the linking is already done.
